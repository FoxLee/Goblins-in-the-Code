# Goblins in the Code
Aesthetic enhancements for Blades in the Dark on Foundry VTT.
Fox has burrowed into your BitD game and is customising a whole bunch of interface elements to suit her tastes! The tweaks also have an eye toward enhanced accessibility and cross-device compatibility.
* **Author**: [FoxLee](https://github.com/FoxLee)
* **Contributors**: Contains code based on the existing [BitD System for Foundry VT](https://github.com/Dez384/foundryvtt-blades-in-the-dark) and reuses some UI graphics.
* **Foundry VTT Compatibility**: v11.x (no v12 compatibility yet)
* **System Compatibility**: [Blades in the Dark](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/blades-in-the-dark) v5.3+ (untested with older versions, but may work)
* **Languages**: [en-AU](https://github.com/FoxLee/fvtt-locale-en-au), en-US

## Features
### New Scoundrel Sheet
A new Scoundrel sheet designed to be responsive, flexible, informative and sexy.
* Select the sheet on a per-character basis, or set it as default (original sheet is still available).
* Colour choices based on the official BitD website.
* Upper and lower panels shift from fixed to toggle-able display depending on window dimensions.
* Scales to be attractive and usable at any size (even phones!).
* Makes heavy use of "tooltip" messages to assist in editing.
* I only speak English, but all text is translation-ready.
### Chat Styles
Enhances the styling of existing "chat cards" (created by rolls/sheet triggers) and adds BitD styling for general chat messages.
* Turn it on/off in the module settings.
* Includes compatibility tweaks for: [Burble](https://github.com/FoxLee/Burble), [Chat Portrait](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/chat-portrait), [DragonFlagon Chat Enhancements](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/df-chat-enhance) and [Simply Portraits](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/simply-portraits). Feel free to request others if you want themâ€”I'll do what I can!
### Global Styles
Tweaks various interface areas to follow BitD stayling (mostly font choices).
* Turn it on/off in the module settings.

## To-Do/In Progress

* New Sheets for all system "items" (powers, feats, gear, etc)
